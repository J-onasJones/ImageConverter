# ImageConverter
A Python based Image converter supporting a bunch of image formats.
### Supported Formats:
`.bmp`, `.dds`, `.dib`, `.eps`, `.gif`, `.icns`, `.ico`, `.im`, `.msp`, `.pcx`, `.png`, `.ppm`, `.sgi`, `.spider`, `.tga`, `.tiff`, `.webp`, `.xbm`, `.palm`, `.pdf`, `.xv`

Note that many more file formats such as `.jpg` and `.jpeg` can be read by the program but not converted into.

### Requirments
The program can be downloaded at the ![Releases](https://github.com/J-onasJones/ImageConverter/releases) page. When using the executable nothing else is required for the program to work. When using the python schript the beloow listed libraries as well as python itself need to be installed.

I recommend creating a shortcut that executes the command automatically and pin it to Start or Taskbar (navigate to StartMenu folder, right click, new > shortcut, command:`C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k python [File location]/ImageConverter_v1.1.py && exit`

##### Required Python libraries
- PIL (install with `pip install pillow`)
- sys (install with `pip install sys`)
- os (install with `pip install os`)
- tkinter (install with `pip install tk`)

**Usually sys and os come already preinstalled along with the python installation**
