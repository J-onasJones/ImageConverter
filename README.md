### Requirments
Python needs to be isntalled for this program to work.
Tkinter doesn't work when .py converted to .exe for some reason - this script uses Tkinter as the graphics library
##### Required Python libraries
- PIL (install with `pip install pillow`)
- sys (install with `pip install sys`)
- os (install with `pip install os`)
- tkinter (install with `pip install tk`)

**Usually sys and os come already preinstalled along with the python installation**
